The government is planning to create a new station Crio Junction near Bangalore, 
your team has already set up the routing for all the trains through this station. 
Now your job is to find the minimum number of platforms that this station should have so that the routing, 
that is defined by your team, is possible.
	You are given the train name, train number, time of arrival(TOA) , time of departure(TOD) and time taken to depart(TTTD) for all the trains. 
There are N trains. You have to find the minimum number of platforms that need to be built and for each train assign a platform to it.

Train which reach the platform first gets the lowest number of platform available. if two trains have the same time of arrival then, the train 
which completely departs first (time of departure + time taken to depart) will get the lower number of platform. if they also depart at the same time then the train
with lower train number gets the lowest platform.

Note -

- Platforms are numbered from 1 to K, where K is the minimum number of platforms required.
- At any time a platform cannot have more than 1 train assigned to it.
- You can assume that the platform will be available after the train has completely departed.
- Your are given the time of arrival, departure and time taken to depart in the format HH:MM:SS.LLL (where LLL is milliseconds) in 24 hours format i.e. starting from 00:00:00.000 to 23:59:59.999
- All train numbers and train names are distinct.

Input Format
First line contains the number of trains.
Each of the next N lines contains Name of train , Train number , Time of arrival, time of departure and time taken to depart.

N
TName TNumber TOA TOD TTTD
.
.
TName TNumber TOA TOD TTTD

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ | TName | ≤ 20
1 ≤ TNumber ≤ 10^9

Output Format
The first line of the output must contain the minimum number of platforms(K) required.
Next N lines should each contain- Train name, Train number and Platform number.
1 ≤ Plaform number ≤ K

Rajdhani 12001 10:40:00.000 10:55:00.000 00:05:00.000
Shatabdi 12002 09:20:10.000 12:00:00.000 00:06:30.000
JanShatabdi 12003 11:00:00.000 12:00:00.000 00:05:00.000

Sample Output 1
2
Rajdhani 12001 2
Shatabdi 12002 1
JanShatabdi 12003 2

Sample Explanation 1

In the first example first Shatabdi will reach the station at 09:20:10 on platform 1 
and leave that platform at 12:00:00 (The platform will be free at 12:06:30). From 10:40:00 to 11:00:00 Rajdhani will be on platform 2 and 
from 11:00:00 to 12:05:00 Janshatabdi will be on platform 2.
